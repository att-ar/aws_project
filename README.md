# AWS Implementation for Data Science and Deep Learning
---
Data Source: either simulated via an app or from real battery test bench (hopefully both to show multi-integration and use of IAM Roles and Users).

- Will store data in S3 buckets.
- Will use parquet files since they are more efficient and smaller.
- Will need to implement Athena and SageMaker in the later stages.
